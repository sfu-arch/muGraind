# Adding and Removing guards

An HLS translates a program dependence graph into an
architectural sketch in Chisel. The architectural sketch is a synthesizable description of the accelerator at the microarchitecture level.
Here is an example of [architecture description file] this file is an intermediate representation in the Chisel language.

Each operator node, which roughly corresponds to an operation/instruction in object code, has a [debug input flag. Line 145 declaration](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/muGrind-playground-BFFE/benchmarks/bbgemm.scala) which is set to either true or false at the beginning. When a debug flag for an operator is set to true the guard circuit will be built in during the FIRRTL (prior to final verilog) generation. The connections between the H-RTL pipeline register and wires to the guard operator is achieved through matching bore and sink pairs. We use the [boring utils framework](https://www.chisel-lang.org/api/latest/chisel3/util/experimental/BoringUtils$.html) to transform the FIRRTL and wire up any [H-RTL signal]() to the guard ports with matching names. corresponding guards. The chisel itself has to only specify a name for the ports; this naming is automatically generated by the HLS compiler.

To help the HLS compiler easily specify where to build in the guard circuit we define a [json api](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/muGrind-playground-BFFE/benchmarks/bbgem_config.json). This file contains

- **NumDBGs** the number of operators being guarded. Helps with resource calculation and trimming based on how much BRAM is left in design.
- **boreIDs**: the IDs of the instructions that are being guarded
- **dataLen**: Width of data lines from the H-RTL operator to guard.

The designer can also intervene and modify the json file (although they are not required to).

## To remove guards

Simply specify and empty `boreIDs` set and `NumDBGs` to 0. FIRRTL will rip out any connections between the H-RTL node and guards and FIRRTL [dead-code elimination]() will remove all the guard circuits and associated logic

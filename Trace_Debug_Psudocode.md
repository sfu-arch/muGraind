# Comparing the process of catching multiple bugs in a tarace based approach VS uGrind


## uGrind

The process is entirely automatic, the user will set the inputs and select the C program, the automated iterative verifier will start verifying the circuit in 3 or more iterations. This process might take minutes or hours based on the user's decision to simulate or synthesis. At the end the user will be presented with a list of all the buggy locations in the circuit, they may then start fixing the bugs.

## Trace-Based
